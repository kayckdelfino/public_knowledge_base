# Cloud

In this folder I keep the acquired knowledge and projects developed on cloud computing during courses and studies.

Here you will find projects developed in IaC (Infrastructure as Code) on AWS using the following technologies:

* **[EC2 - Terraform / Ansible](https://github.com/kayckdelfino/public_knowledge_base/tree/main/Cloud/IaC)**
* **[Elastic Beanstalk - Terraform / Docker](https://github.com/kayckdelfino/public_knowledge_base/tree/main/Cloud/IaC-Container-Beanstalk)**
* **[ECS - Terraform / Docker](https://github.com/kayckdelfino/public_knowledge_base/tree/main/Cloud/IaC-Container-ECS)**
* **[EKS - Terraform / Kubernetes](https://github.com/kayckdelfino/public_knowledge_base/tree/main/Cloud/IaC-Container-EKS)**
