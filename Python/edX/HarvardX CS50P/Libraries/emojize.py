# Emojize
# Because emoji aren‚Äôt quite as easy to type as text, at least on laptops and desktops, some programs support ‚Äúcodes,‚Äù whereby you can type, for instance, :thumbs_up:, which will be automatically converted to üëç. Some programs additionally support aliases, whereby you can more succinctly type, for instance, :thumbsup:, which will also be automatically converted to üëç.
# 
# See carpedm20.github.io/emoji/all.html?enableList=enable_list_alias for a list of codes with aliases.
# 
# In a file called emojize.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a str in English and then outputs the ‚Äúemojized‚Äù version of that str, converting any codes (or aliases) therein to their corresponding emoji.
# 
# Hints
# - Note that the emoji module comes with two functions, per pypi.org/project/emoji, one of which is emojize, which takes an optional, named parameter called language. You can install it with:
# 
# pip install emoji
# 
# Demo
# $ python emojize.py                                                             
# Input: :thumbs_up:                                                              
# Output: üëç
