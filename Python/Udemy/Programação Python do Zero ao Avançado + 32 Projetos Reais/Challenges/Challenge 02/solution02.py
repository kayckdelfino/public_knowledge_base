# For this challenge, I want you to declare two variables: one called "name", which should store your first name as a string, and another called "age", which should store your age as an integer. After that, I want you to print a sentence on the screen that says "Hello, my name is [name] and I am [age] years old." Remember to replace [name] and [age] with the values ​​of the variables you declared.


# Creating two variables
name = "Kayck" # string
age = 20 # integer
