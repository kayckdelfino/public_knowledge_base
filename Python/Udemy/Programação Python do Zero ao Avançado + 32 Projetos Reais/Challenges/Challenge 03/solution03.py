# In this challenge, I ask you to declare two variables: "num1" which must store the integer number 10 and "num2" which must store the floating point number 3.5. After that, I want you to perform and print on the screen the result of dividing "num1" by "num2".


num1 = 10
num2 = 3.5

result = num1 / num2

print("The result of the division is", result)
