## Basic Concepts

### What are Shell/Linux Commands?

**Shell commands**, often referred to as **Linux commands**, are instructions given to the `shell` (command-line interpreter) to perform various tasks in the Unix/Linux operating system environment. They facilitate interactions with the system, file manipulation, process management, and more.

### Why Use Shell/Linux Commands?

**Shell commands** offer a powerful and efficient way to navigate and control the Unix/Linux operating system. They provide a versatile toolkit for users to manage files, execute programs, automate tasks, and administer system resources.
