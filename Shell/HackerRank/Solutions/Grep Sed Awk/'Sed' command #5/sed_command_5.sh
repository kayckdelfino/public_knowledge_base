# 
# [Sed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed) is a popular utility which enables quick parsing and transformation of text.
# 
# Here are some very simple examples of sed in action.
# 
# Substitute the first occurrence of 'editor' with 'tool'.
# 
# `$:~/hackerrank/bash/grep/grep1$` echo "My favorite programming editor is Emacs. Another editor I like is Vim." | sed -e s/editor/tool/
# My favorite programming tool is Emacs. Another editor I like is Vim.
# 
# Substitute all the occurrences of 'editor' with 'tool'.
# 
# `$:~/hackerrank/bash/grep/grep1$` echo "My favorite programming editor is Emacs. Another editor I like is Vim." | sed -e s/editor/tool/g
# My favorite programming tool is Emacs. Another tool I like is Vim.  
# 
# Substitute the second occurrence of 'editor' with 'tool'.
# 
# `$:~/hackerrank/bash/grep/grep1$` echo "My favorite programming editor is Emacs. Another editor I like is Vim." | sed -e s/editor/tool/2
# My favorite programming editor is Emacs. Another tool I like is Vim.
# 
# Highlight all the occurrences of 'editor' by wrapping them up in brace brackets.
# 
# `$:~/hackerrank/bash/grep/grep1$` echo "My favorite programming editor is Emacs. Another editor I like is Vim." | sed -e s/editor/{\&}/g
# My favorite programming {editor} is Emacs. Another {editor} I like is Vim.

# Task
# Given an input file, with N credit card numbers, each in a new line, your task is to reverse the ordering of segments in each credit card number. Assume that the credit card numbers will have 4 space separated segments with 4 digits each.
# 
# If the original credit card number is 1434 5678 9101 1234, transform it to 1234 9101 5678 1434.
# 
# Useful References: [This particular page on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2232200/regular-expression-in-sed-for-masking-credit-card) has a relevant example about sed, groups and backreferences. [Here's](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2009/10/unix-sed-tutorial-advanced-sed-substitution-examples/) a detailed tutorial covering groups and backreferences.
# 
# Input Format
# N credit card numbers, each in a new line, credit card numbers will have 4 space separated segments with 4 digits each.
# 
# Constraints
# - 1 <= N <= 20
# However, the value of N does not matter while writing your command.
# 
# Output Format
# N lines, each containing a credit card number with the ordering of its segments reversed.
# 
# Sample Input
# 1234 5678 9101 1234  
# 2999 5178 9101 2234  
# 9999 5628 9201 1232  
# 8888 3678 9101 1232
# 
# Sample Output
# 1234 9101 5678 1234  
# 2234 9101 5178 2999  
# 1232 9201 5628 9999  
# 1232 9101 3678 8888 
# 
# Explanation
# The order of the four segments in the (input) credit card numbers have been reversed.
