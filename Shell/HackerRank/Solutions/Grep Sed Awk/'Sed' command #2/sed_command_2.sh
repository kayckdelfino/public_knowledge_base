# Challenge statement: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/text-processing-in-linux-the-sed-command-2/problem
# 
# Objective
# In this challenge, we will practice using the sed command to parse and transform text.
# 
# Resources
# [Sed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed) is a popular tool that enables quick parsing and transformation of text.
# 
# Examples of sed in action:
# 
# Substitute the first occurrence of 'editor' with 'tool':
# 
# `$:~/hackerrank/bash/grep/grep1$` echo "My favorite programming editor is Emacs. Another editor I like is Vim." | sed -e s/editor/tool/
# My favorite programming tool is Emacs. Another editor I like is Vim.
# 
# Substitute all the occurrences of 'editor' with 'tool':
# 
# `$:~/hackerrank/bash/grep/grep1$` echo "My favorite programming editor is Emacs. Another editor I like is Vim." | sed -e s/editor/tool/g
# My favorite programming tool is Emacs. Another tool I like is Vim.  
# 
# Substitute the second occurrence of 'editor' with 'tool':
# 
# `$:~/hackerrank/bash/grep/grep1$` echo "My favorite programming editor is Emacs. Another editor I like is Vim." | sed -e s/editor/tool/2
# My favorite programming editor is Emacs. Another tool I like is Vim.
# 
# Highlight all the occurrences of 'editor' by wrapping them up in brace brackets:
# 
# `$:~/hackerrank/bash/grep/grep1$` echo "My favorite programming editor is Emacs. Another editor I like is Vim." | sed -e s/editor/{\&}/g
# My favorite programming {editor} is Emacs. Another {editor} I like is Vim.

# 
# Task
# For each line in a given input file, transform all the occurrences of the word 'thy' with 'your'. The search should be case insensitive, i.e. 'thy', 'Thy', 'tHy' etc. should be transformed to 'your'.
# 
# Input Format
# A text file will be piped into your command via STDIN.
# 
# Output Format
# Transform and display the text as required in the task.
# 
# Sample Input
# From fairest creatures we desire increase,
# That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
# But as the riper should by time decease,
# His tender heir might bear his memory:
# But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
# Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
# Making a famine where abundance lies,
# Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
# Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
# And only herald to the gaudy spring,
# Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
# And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
# Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
# To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
# When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,
# And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
# Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,
# Will be a tattered weed of small worth held:
# Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,
# Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;
# To say within thine own deep sunken eyes,
# Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.
# How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,
# If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
# Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse'
# 
# Sample Output
# From fairest creatures we desire increase,
# That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
# But as the riper should by time decease,
# His tender heir might bear his memory:
# But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
# Feed'st your light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
# Making a famine where abundance lies,
# your self your foe, to your sweet self too cruel:
# Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
# And only herald to the gaudy spring,
# Within thine own bud buriest your content,
# And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
# Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
# To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
# When forty winters shall besiege your brow,
# And dig deep trenches in your beauty's field,
# your youth's proud livery so gazed on now,
# Will be a tattered weed of small worth held:
# Then being asked, where all your beauty lies,
# Where all the treasure of your lusty days;
# To say within thine own deep sunken eyes,
# Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.
# How much more praise deserved your beauty's use,
# If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
# Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse'  
# 
# Explanation
# The line:
# 
# "Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel," 
# 
# has been transformed to:
# 
# "Feed'st your light's flame with self-substantial fuel,"  
# 
# The line:
# 
# "Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:" 
# 
# has been transformed to:
# 
# "your self your foe, to your sweet self too cruel:"
