# You are provided a file with four space-separated columns containing the scores of students in three subjects. The first column, contains a single character (A-Z) - the identifier of the student. The next three columns have three numbers (each between 0 and 100, both inclusive) which are the scores of the students in English, Mathematics and Science respectively.
# 
# Input Format
# There will be no more than 10 rows of data. Each line will be in the format:
# [Identifier]<space>[Score in English]<space>[Score in Math]<space>[Score in Science]
# 
# Output Format
# Concatenate every 2 lines of input with a semi-colon.
# 
# Sample Input
# A 25 27 50
# B 35 37 75

# Sample Output
# A 25 27 50;B 35 37 75
# C 75 78 80;D 99 88 76 
# 
# Explanation
