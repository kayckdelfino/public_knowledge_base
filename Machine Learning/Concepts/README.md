# Machine Learning Concepts Repository

This repository is dedicated to storing notes and principal concepts acquired during my Machine Learning studies.

## Notes Folders

### Purpose
The `Concepts` folder within this `Machine Learning` repository serves as a centralized location for storing personal study materials, including resumes, references, and resources from various platform courses.

### Contents
Inside the `Concepts` folder, you'll find subfolders corresponding to different subjects. Each subfolder is named with the subject covered, containing respective materials:

- [Basics](https://github.com/kayckdelfino/public_knowledge_base/tree/main/Machine%20Learning/Concepts/Basics)
  - Explore the foundational principles of Machine Learning, including terminology, algorithms, and applications. Gain insights into the key concepts that form the backbone of ML.
- [Neural Networks](https://github.com/kayckdelfino/public_knowledge_base/tree/main/Machine%20Learning/Concepts/Neural%20Networks)
  - Dive into the world of Neural Networks, covering architectures, training methodologies, and real-world applications. Understand the intricacies of feedforward networks, convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and more, unlocking the potential of deep learning in solving complex problems.
