# Neural Networks

Neural networks are a class of **machine learning algorithms** inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. They are composed of interconnected nodes, or neurons, organized in layers. Each neuron receives input signals, processes them using an *activation function*, and produces an output signal. Neural networks are capable of learning complex patterns and relationships from data, making them powerful tools for various tasks in artificial intelligence.

## Key Concepts

- **Neuron:** The basic computational unit of a neural network, which receives input signals, applies weights to them, and produces an output signal.
- **Layer:** A collection of neurons that process input data collectively. Neural networks typically consist of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.
- **Activation Function:** A mathematical function applied to the output of each neuron, determining whether it should be activated (*fire*) based on the input it receives.
- **Weights and Biases:** Parameters associated with the connections between neurons, which are adjusted during the training process to optimize the network's performance.
- **Forward Propagation:** The process of passing input data through the network to generate predictions or outputs. It involves multiplying input values by weights, applying activation functions, and passing the result to subsequent layers.
- **Backpropagation:** An algorithm used to train neural networks by adjusting the network's weights and biases based on the difference between predicted outputs and actual outputs. It involves computing gradients of the loss function with respect to the network's parameters and updating them using gradient descent or similar optimization techniques.

## Types of Neural Networks

### Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)
- **Description:** The simplest form of neural networks, where information flows in one direction, from input nodes to output nodes. They are used for tasks like classification and regression.
- **Architecture:** Consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer, with connections between adjacent layers but no feedback loops.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- **Description:** Specialized neural networks designed for processing structured grid-like data, such as images. They leverage convolutional layers to automatically learn hierarchical patterns and spatial relationships in the input data.
- **Architecture:** Typically composed of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Convolutional layers apply filters to input images to extract features, while pooling layers downsample feature maps to reduce computational complexity.

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- **Description:** Neural networks designed to handle sequential data by maintaining an internal memory state, allowing them to capture temporal dependencies and process sequences of variable length.
- **Architecture:** Utilizes feedback loops to connect previous time steps' outputs to the current time step's inputs, enabling the network to retain information over time. Common variants include Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks.

### Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
- **Description:** A framework comprising two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, trained simultaneously through adversarial training. The generator network generates synthetic data samples, while the discriminator network learns to distinguish between real and generated data.
- **Architecture:** The generator attempts to generate realistic-looking data samples to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator aims to differentiate between real and fake samples. This adversarial process leads to the generation of high-quality synthetic data.
