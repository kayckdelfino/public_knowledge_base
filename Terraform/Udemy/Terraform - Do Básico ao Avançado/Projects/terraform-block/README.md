# terraform-block

## Overview

This Terraform configuration demonstrates a multi-cloud setup with AWS and Azure providers. The `main.tf` file sets up the Terraform configuration with required versions for AWS and Azure providers and initializes an Azure backend. This example provides a basic structure for a multi-cloud project.

## File Structure

### `main.tf`

- Specifies the required versions for AWS and Azure providers.
- Initializes the Azure backend.

## Configuration

### `terraform` Block

- Defines the required Terraform version (~> 1.0.0).
- Specifies required providers for AWS and Azure with version constraints.
- Configures the Azure backend for remote state storage.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Terraform installed (version 1.0.0 or later).
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory.
4. Execute `terraform validate` to validate the configurations.
5. If using remote state storage, configure the Azure backend with appropriate details.
6. Execute `terraform apply` to apply the changes and configure AWS and Azure providers.
7. Monitor the console output for any errors or warnings.
8. Feel free to customize the configuration based on your multi-cloud requirements.
