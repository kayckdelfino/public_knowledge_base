-- 
-- The maximum earnings value is 69952. The only employee with earnings = 69952 is Kimberly, so we print the maximum earnings value (69952) and a count of the number of employees who have earned $69952 (which is 1) as two space-separated values.


SELECT (salary * months) as earnings, count(*)
FROM employee
GROUP BY earnings
ORDER BY earnings DESC 
LIMIT 1;
