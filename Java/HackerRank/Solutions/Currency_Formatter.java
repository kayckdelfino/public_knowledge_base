Challenge statement: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-currency-formatter/problem

Given a double-precision number, payment, denoting an amount of money, use the NumberFormat class' getCurrencyInstance method to convert payment into the US, Indian, Chinese, and French currency formats. Then print the formatted values as follows:

US: formattedPayment
India: formattedPayment
